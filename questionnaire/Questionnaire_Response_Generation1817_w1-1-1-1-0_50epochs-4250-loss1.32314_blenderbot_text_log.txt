Context: I was most taken aback to learn that someone was not who I thought they were. It was more a statement on how I chose to see them, rather anything that was their fault. A good lesson. 

Prompt:  Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own "vision" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?

Response 2:  I know exactly what you mean. It's hard to know who to trust these days.
